lold - LolShield Daemon

----
Usage:
Flash the lold_firmware sketch to your Arduino,
keep it connected via USB.

Build lold and lolplay with make.
Start ./lold -d /dev/ttyUSB*
where ttyUSB* or something similar is your Arduino device.

You are ready to go!

Now you can send animations to your LolShield. Try
./lolplay -m "Hello world"
or try running ./lolmpd.sh if you use MPD.

In ruby-lold you can find the old lold ruby implementation.

Troubleshooting:
If the output does not work, check whether the
permissions on the device are not too strict,
add user to uucp group if necessary.
I just do
  chmod 777 /run/lock
  chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
to make it work.

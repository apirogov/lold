lold - LolShield Daemon

Usage:
Flash the lold_firmware sketch to your Arduino,
keep it connected via USB.

Start lold.rb -d /dev/ttyUSB*
where ttyUSB* or something similar is your Arduino device.

You are ready to go!

Now you can send animations to your LolShield. Try
./lolplay.rb -m "Hello world"
or try running ./lolmpd.rb


Troubleshooting:
If the output does not work, check whether the
permissions on the device are not too strict,
I just do chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 to make it work right.
